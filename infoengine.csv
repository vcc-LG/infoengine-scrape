The Good Care Group - Live in Care,The Good Care Group - Live in Care,"The Good Care Group was founded in 2009 with a vision of becoming the leading provider of high quality home care services that enable people to live well in their home for longer and avoid the stress of moving into a residential care home.  The motivation behind establishing The Good Care Group came from a mix of personal experience in searching for care for relatives and realisation that there were very few home care providers delivering a truly high quality service. The founders' ambition was to establish an organisation that was able to drive up standards, professionalise home care and lead the way in the care sector.The Good Care Group’s first office was opened in London in 2009. In 2012 home care services were launched in Edinburgh, Scotland.  In 2014 we will be establishing local offices in Surrey and Kent, although our home care services are available throughout England and Scotland, they are delivered on a local basis through the regional care teams.","The Tower Building, York Rd,,Lambeth,,London,SE1 7NQ",Older People,,,,,,,,

Eglwyswrw and District Heritage Society,Eglwyswrw and District Heritage Society,"The Eglwyswrw & District Heritage Society was initially started by residents, Paul Sambrook and Dave Jenkins. Then in October 2005 the group began regular meetings in the local pub, The Butchers Arms. Local people and those who had recently moved into the district met with the aim of finding out about the history of their village and their homes. By early 2006 the membership of the group had grown to over 20 people and they decided to work together to gather old photographs and information. Soon they had so many photographs that they were scanned, and a DVD was made, these were sold for £5 each. This was so popular that two further DVDs have been produced and hundreds have been sold and sent all over the country. However, despite extensive searches, there was one photograph that eluded the group – one showing the famous Meigan Fair that was held in Eglwyswrw every November. If anyone can help with the search, we would be very pleased to hear from you.With Meigan Fair in mind the group decided to commemorate the event with an Open Day in the Old Village School – Yr Hen Ysgol and on 24th November 2007 the hall was filled with artefacts, photographs, maps, books and newspaper scrapbooks. The day was hailed as a huge success and the profile of the group was raised.Then in early 2008 the group decided to embark upon their biggest challenge – to produce a book of the memories of their community, in words and photographs. For almost two years they worked collecting stories and memories. Then, on 12th December 2009 the book was launched to critical acclaim.The book sold well, and it has been posted abroad to families who once came from the area and to those who have been researching their ancestry. Since then the group have gone from strength to strength, membership for most years is around 30 - 40. They have all enjoyed listening to the stories of the regular guest speakers at the Butchers Arms and Yr hen Ysgol. Day trips to places such as the National Library of Wales at Aberystwyth, the gardens at Aberglasney, and of course St Fagans the Welsh Folk Museum has been very successful. As have the ‘walk and talk’ days where we have explored our village and other places of interest such as the P.O.W. Camp at Henllan and the local ‘Ty Canol’ woods. Over the years the Society has continued its work, collecting and recording history of the locality. We have been fortunate to receive donations of varied local history related documents and photographs. There are always projects being worked on. The most prominent to date was the James Brothers project so named as it was the first in a series of projects, for which the Society has received a substantial Lottery Grant.In February 2013 the Society held workshops at the Shire Horse Farm, as part of the James Brothers project managed by Rheinallt James. Children of all ages and ability were given the chance to use tools of the period of Howard and Herbert James of Narberth who built and then flew their ‘Caudron Biplane’ some hundred years ago. The children worked on shaping a propeller, making flying helmets of leather as well as building an apparatus for steam bending lengths of wood. It was rewarding to see youngsters getting to grips with tools of yesteryear with many showing good level of skill. The second workshop saw even more people involved.We continue to visit sites of historical interest, Gower Heritage Centre; Waterfront Museum in Swansea; Cardigan Castle; Manordeifi Church; Iron Age Fort, Castell Henllys; Cenarth Coracle Museum to name a few. In recent years we have concentrated on places of historical interest in our home county of Pembrokeshire.We have attended meetings by 'Affiliation of History Societies' at Haverfordwest Library for lectures on a wide variety of history related topics sadly these have discontinued.The Society exhibited the James Brothers Caudron biplane, a life size model complete with a simulator at the Urdd Eisteddfod 2013 at Boncath, and the National Eisteddfod in Llanelli the following year.There have been aviation related trips arranged. The most memorable was our visit to Control Tower, Carew where enthusiastic Control Tower volunteers described war time life at the base in an entertaining manner. A day that adults and youngsters alike will remember for a long time to come.Our visit to Sunderland Trust at Pembroke Dock was also a fine experience.We have been able help family historians from this country and abroad who have contacted the Society with enquiries about their ancestors, who once lived in our neighbourhood. We have continued to find very able speakers who have spoken on varied topics such as Cardigan Castle; The Cardi Bach; The Barony of Cemaes and Maritime Heritage of West Wales to name just a few.In the past we have commemorated Meigan Fair with a sing along in the Butchers Arms and we will be commemorating the fair in future years.The Society working with other parties started a project to erect a War Memorial for Eglwyswrw and surrounding area, twenty-five people are known to have died mainly during the First World War. Our intention was to have a memorial erected in memory of these men by the centenary of the start of World War One.A Service of Memorial and Dedication of the new War Memorial was held at St Cristiolus Church, Eglwyswrw on Sunday, August 10th, 2014.Around the same time as our Heritage Society started the War Memorial project, we began another, to remember the two boys Milton Jones and Donald Pritchard who were killed in an accident on the Preseli hills in 1944, when the boys handled or moved military ordnance which exploded, killing both.This project had many facets aimed to help young people be aware of local as well as wartime history.A service was held on August 31st, 2014 to unveil a plaque in their memory at Seion Chapel Crymych with the Sunday School children taking a prominent part.The success of the Society is due to the hard work of members and the support from the community and further afield.Our Society has recently had the privilege to work alongside others on a project to remember Revd. Benjamin Thomas (Myfyr Emlyn), one of north Pembrokeshire’s famous sons. A Baptist Minister, Poet, Lecturer and Author. Born in a little cottage on the edge of the northern slope of the Preseli hills in 1836, he took advantage of the modest education available. Though he was one of many who were raised to become ministers of religion from an area known locally as ‘Rhos Glynmaen’, he was the most famous.We are grateful for all the help we have received on this project from many different sources.On Saturday, October 21st at 1.30pm, a Service of Appreciation and Unveiling of the Myfyr Emlyn Memorial Stone was held at Bethabara Chapel, Pontyglasier, featuring some of his work in Welsh and in English - Poems, Hymns and Songs. Our work continues.",,"Arts/Culture/Heritage,Community",eglwyswrwheritage@gmail.com,http://eglwyswrwheritage.org.uk,,,,,,
Cymdeithas Treftadaeth Eglwyswrw a'r Fro.,Eglwyswrw and District Heritage Society,"Plannwyd egin y Gymdeithas drwy weledigaeth dau o’r ardal – Paul Sambrook a Dave Jenkins. Erbyn Hydref 2005 roedd cyfarfodydd rheolaidd yn cael eu trefnu yn Nhafarn y Butchers. Cyfarfu pobl leol ynghyd â rhai a sefydlodd yn yr ardal i ddarganfod hanes am eu cartrefi a’u cymdogaeth. Erbyn 2006 roedd aelodaeth y grwp wedi codi i 20 a phenderfynwyd cydweithio drwy gasglu lluniau i ychwanegu at y casgliad gwreiddiol. Cyn hir roedd digon o luniau i’w sganio i wneud cryno ddisg (DVD) a’u gwerthu am £5 yr un. Bu’r fenter yn boblogaidd gyda digon o adnoddau i gynhyrchu dwy ddisg arall. Cyn bo hir roeddynt wedi eu dosbarthu ymhell ac agos.Sut bynnag, er chwilota a holi dyfal, mae un llun ar goll – llun yn dangos unrhyw agwedd o’r hen Ffair Feigan – y ffair nodedig a gynhaliwyd yn flynyddol yn Eglwyswrw tua diwedd mis Tachwedd. Os gall unrhyw un lenwi’r bwlch buasem yn falch petaech yn cysylltu a ni.I gofio Ffair Feigan penderfynwyd trefnu achlysur penodol. Cynhaliwyd Dydd Agored yn Yr Hen Ysgol ar 24ain o Dachwedd 2007, gydag arddangosfa o arteffactau, lluniau, mapiau, llyfrau cyfeirio a llyfrau lloffion. Bu’n ddiwrnod o lwyddiant ysgubol a gododd broffil y gymdeithas.Yn ystod misoedd cynnar 2008 cytunwyd i ymgymryd a menter heriol – cynhyrchu llyfr o atgofion ein bro mewn hanesion a lluniau. Bu cywain, didoli a chyflwyno cynnyrch am bron ddwy flynedd. Yna lansiwyd y llyfr ymysg canmoliaeth uchelMae rhan fwyaf o'r llyfrau wedi eu gwerthu gyda chanran wedi eu dosbarthu dros Brydain a thramor i deuluoedd sy’n ymchwilio eu gwreiddiau. Ffynnu o nerth i nerth yw hanes y Gymdeithas. Mae aelodaeth rhan fwyaf o flynyddoedd tua 30 - 40.  Bu bri ar wrando ar hanesion a phrofiadau siaradwyr gwadd yng nghyfarfodydd cyson yn Nhafarn y Butchers a’r Hen Ysgol.Trefnir ymweliadau i leoedd megis y Llyfrgell Genedlaethol, Aberystwyth, Gerddi Aberglasney, ac wrth gwrs i Amgueddfa Werin San Ffagan. Bu siwrneiau nes adref diddorol megis teithiau cerdded i Garnedd Meibion Owen a gallt Tycanol ac ymweliad cofiadwy dros y ffin i Sir Gâr i’r Eglwys Eidalaidd yn Henllan. Rhaid peidio anghofio hefyd y pleser o droedio llwybrau a darganfod atyniadau lleol o fewn ein pentref - Eglwyswrw. Dros y blynyddoedd mae'r Gymdeithas wedi parhau ei gwaith o gasglu a chofnodi hanes yr ardal. Rydym wedi bod yn ffodus i dderbyn rhoddion o ddogfennau a ffotograffau sy'n gysylltiedig â hanes lleol. Mae yna bob amser brosiectau ar y gweill. Y mwyaf amlwg oedd y prosiect Brodyr James, wedi ei enwi felly gan mae hyn oedd y cyntaf mewn gyfres o brosiectau mae'r Gymdeithas wedi derbyn Grant y Loteri sylweddol ar eu cyfer.Yn Chwefror 2013 cynhaliodd y Gymdeithas weithdai yn y Fferm Ceffylau Gwedd, fel rhan o'r brosiect Brodyr James a’i reolir gan Rheinallt James, lle roedd plant o bob oed a gallu wedi cael y cyfle i ddefnyddio offer o gyfnod Howard a Herbert James o Arberth a adeiladodd ac yna hedfan eu ‘Caudron Biplane' gan mlynedd yn ôl. Bu’r plant yn gweithio ar ‘propeller’, a gwneud helmedau hedfan o ledr yn ogystal ac adeiladu cyfarpar stêm ar gyfer plygu pren. Yr oedd yn hyfryd i weld pobl ifanc yn defnyddio hen offer oedd ar gael yn amser y Brodyr James, gyda llawer yn dangos lefel dda o sgiliau. Yn yr ail weithdy roedd hyd yn oed mwy o bobl yn cymryd rhan.Rydym yn parhau i ymweld â safleoedd o ddiddordeb hanesyddol, Canolfan Dreftadaeth Gwyr, Amgueddfa Genedlaethol y Glannau yn Abertawe, Castell Aberteifi, Eglwys Manordeifi, Caer Oes yr Haearn, Castell Henllys, Amgueddfa Cwryglau Cenarth i enwi ond ychydig.Yn ystod y blynyddoedd diwethaf rydym wedi canolbwyntio ar lefydd o ddiddordeb hanesyddol yn Sir Benfro.Rydym wedi mynychu cyfarfodydd ar gyfer 'Aelodaeth o Gymdeithasau Hanes' yn Llyfrgell Hwlffordd i wrando ar ddarlithoedd o amrywiaeth o bynciau yn gysylltiedig â hanes. Yn anffodus mae'r rhain wedi dod i ben.Ddangosodd y Gymdeithas fodel o awyren y Brodyr James, gyda efelychydd yn Eisteddfod yr Urdd 2013 ym Moncath, a hefyd yn Eisteddfod Genedlaethol Cymru 2014, yn Llanelli, mwynhawyd hefyd teithiau i lefydd a oedd yn gysylltiedig ag awyrennau.Y mwyaf cofiadwy oedd ein hymweliad i ‘Control Tower, Carew’ lle disgrifiodd y gwirfoddolwyr brwdfrydig sut oedd bywyd amser y rhyfel yn R.A.F. Carew a hynny mewn modd difyr, diwrnod fydd oedolion a phobl ifanc fel ei gilydd yn cofio am amser hir i ddod. Hefyd roedd ymweld a Ymddiriedolaeth Sunderland yn Noc Penfro yn brofiad gwych.Yr ydym wedi helpu haneswyr teuluol o’r wlad hon a thramor a wnaeth gysylltu â'r Gymdeithas gydag ymholiadau am eu cyndeidiau a oedd wedi byw yn yr ardal hon.Rydym wedi bod yn ffodus i ddod o hyd i siaradwyr galluog iawn sydd wedi siarad ar bynciau amrywiol megis Castell Aberteifi, Y Cardi Bach, Barwniaeth Cemais a Threftadaeth Forwrol Gorllewin Cymru i enwi dim ond rhai.Yn ystod y blynyddoedd rydym wedi coffáu Ffair Feigan gyda noson o ganu yn y Butchers Arms. Byddwn yn coffau’r Ffair eto yn y dyfodol. Bu y Gymdeithas yn gweithio gyda phartïon eraill i godi Cofeb Rhyfel ar gyfer Eglwyswrw a'r ardal gyfagos. Mae pump ar hugain o bobl yr ardal wedi marw mewn rhyfel, yn bennaf yn ystod y Rhyfel Byd Cyntaf, ein bwriad oedd codi cofeb er cof am y dynion hyn erbyn canmlwyddiant dechrau Ryfel Byd Cyntaf.Cafodd gwasanaeth Goffa a Chysegru y Gofeb newydd ei gynnal yn Eglwys St Cristiolus, Eglwyswrw ar Ddydd Sul y 10fed o Awst, 2014.Tua'r un amser dechreuodd y Gymdeithas prosiect arall i gofio'r ddau fachgen, sef Milton Jones a Donald Pritchard a bu farw mewn damwain ar y Preseli yn 1944, pan wnaeth y bechgyn drin neu symud ordnans milwrol a ffrwydrodd, gan ladd y ddau.Roedd gan y prosiect hwn sawl agwedd yn anelu i helpu pobl ifanc fod yn ymwybodol o hanes lleol yn ogystal â hanes rhyfel.Cynhaliwyd gwasanaeth ar Awst 31ain i ddadorchuddio plac er cof am y ddau yng nghapel Seion Crymych gyda phlant yr Ysgol Sul yn cymryd rhan flaenllaw.Mae llwyddiant y Gymdeithas yn ganlyniad o waith caled yr aelodau a'r gefnogaeth gan y gymuned ac o ymhellach i ffwrdd.Yn 2017 cafodd y Gymdeithas y fraint i weithio ochr yn ochr ag eraill ar brosiect i gofioY Parchg. Benjamin Thomas (Myfyr Emlyn), un o feibion enwog Gogledd Sir Benfro.Gweinidog y Bedyddwyr, Bardd, Darlithydd ac Awdur.Ganwyd mewn bwthyn bach ar ymyl llethr gogleddol bryniau'r Preseli ym 1836, manteisiodd ar yr ychydig addysg leol a oedd ar gael. Er fod llawer o weinidogion wedi eu magu yn ardal a elwir yn lleol fel 'Rhos Glynmaen', ef oedd y mwyaf enwog.Rydym yn ddiolchgar am yr holl gymorth a gawsom ar y prosiect hwn o sawl ffynhonnell wahanol.Ar Ddydd Sadwrn, Hydref 21ain 2017 am 1.30yp, cynhaliwyd Gwasanaeth o Werthfawrogiad  - a Seremoni Dadorchuddio Carreg Goffa Myfyr Emlyn yng Nghapel Bethabara, Pontyglasier, gan gynnwys peth o'i waith yn Gymraeg ac yn Saesneg, Cerddi, Emynau a Chaneuon. Mae ein gwaith yn parhau.",,"Arts/Culture/Heritage,Community",eglwyswrwheritage@gmail.com,http://eglwyswrwheritage.org.uk/,,,,,,

Sova Achieving Change through Employment (ACE),Sova Cymru,"Sova ACE’s specialism in supporting people from BME and Migrant backgrounds is what makes our project different from the others.Barriers that prevent learners from BME & Migrant communities from engaging in ETE include:Lack of awareness of ETE support opportunities among both communities and those whose job it is to give advice; Few visible role models from the BME & Migrant communities;Difficulties in finding suitable work and work placements, especially where employers believe there will be a need to provide additional support;Real or perceived discrimination;Language difficulties for people for whom English is an additional language;Cultural differences making integration with other cultures a challenge;Available support for people not being accessed or fully utilised;Insufficient co-ordination between education and training providers, employers and local community organisations to promote ETE opportunities.Sova ACE is organised so that cultural preferences, such as the gender of a worker, can be accommodated as far as practicable.  It is important to set out what is appropriate for each community, and for each individual, but overall ACE has made a commitment to:• be aware of cultural differences• avoid making culturally specific assumptions• ask people how their needs can be met in an appropriate way.Sova ACE’s Key Approaches to working with BME and Migrant Communities:• Incorporate new approaches as part of daily activities and make small changes to routines.• Start with less demanding activities and build up as you go.• Involve places of worship in promoting activities.• Highlight the benefits of ETE activities in community languages in light of feeling healthier and easing stress.• Be culturally sensitive to people’s needs concerning dress and segregation when carrying out activities.• Adapt activities to take account of culture and faith.• Offer women-only sessions and female coaches and mentors.• Respect issues of modesty, to allow the head to be covered and participants to wear clothing they feel comfortable with.• Be aware that fasting is practised by most religions in different ways (this may result in dehydration and low sugar levels).• Account for different perceptions of employment and training, e.g. some female groups may consider certain activities as more appropriate for them.• Involve BME individuals in planning and implementing change at a pace that suits them.• Go to places where BME groups feel most comfortable rather than expecting them to come to us.• Offer activity sessions with a mentor to provide support and encouragementWho can be referred?Participants have to meet the following criteria:1.	From A BME or migrant background 2.	Be over 25 years of age3.	Be eligible to live and work in the UK4.	a) Be unemployed for over 12 months (can be claiming JSA but not on the Work programme) OR4.	b) Be Economically inactive (can be claiming ESA, or HB but not JSA) and be either from a jobless household, have qualifications on or below CQFW Level 2, have a work limiting health condition or disability, have care or child care responsibilities or be aged over 54. How can I refer someone who I think is eligible?Please complete our electronic referral form (www.sova.org.uk/project/ACE) and email it to ace@sova.org.uk.

24 Hour Interpreting Services - Communication Agency,Wales Council For Deaf People,"Our efficient service can help facilitate communication between public service personnel and deaf/hard of hearing people.Our Communication Agency has run for over 20 years covering all of Wales and we have a wealth of experience in this field.Why would a Language Support Professional be needed?The Equality and Human Rights Act makes it unlawful to discriminate against a disabled person for reasons of their disability. This means all public services must make reasonable adjustment to allow disabled people to use their services.In the case of Deaf or hard of hearing people unless you already have in-house facilities for language support you will need to give some thought as to how your organisation can fulfill its obligations to the thousands of people in Wales who are Deaf or hard of hearing.Wales Council For Deaf People can provide British Sign Language (BSL) Interpreters, Lip speakers and Speech To Text Operatives to facilitate language support for Deaf and hard of hearing people.British Sign Language (BSL) InterpretersBSL is the first or preferred language of deaf people, and has been recognised as a language in its own right in Wales.BSL interpreters have undergone many years of training and are able to provide the service needed to enable communication between Deaf and hearing people.Lip SpeakersSome deaf and most hard of hearing people have spoken language as their first or preferred language. Communication can be via lipreading and spoken language. Lipreading can be quite difficult and is generally tiring. Lip speakers have been trained to a high level of ability to convey the spoken word so that it is understood by the Deaf or hard of hearing person.Speech To Text ServicesSome Deaf and hard of hearing people who use spoken language as their first or preferred language find lipreading too difficult at times and prefer to read the ""spoken"" word. Spoken language can be changed into text as it is spoken by a Speech To Text Reporter using a special keyboard/screen set-up.CANCELLATIONSCancellation will be charged at half fee if cancelled within 14 days and full fee if cancelled within 7 days. If the communication support worker has to cancel the onus would be on them to find an alternate communication support worker unless a good reason could be given to the contrary. Cancellation fees are normally only payable after deduction of any similar fees the interpreter may receive as a result of finding alternative assignments.IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES WALES COUNCIL FOR DEAF PEOPLE MUST BE NOTIFIED.To book our interpreting services (between 9 AM - 5 PM) Please call 01443 485687 or e-mail mail@wcdeaf.org.ukTo book our interpreting services (out of hours) Please call or text 07572023052","Glenview House,Courthouse Street,Pontypridd,cf37 1jy",,laura@wcdeaf.org.uk,,,01443485687,"Toilets,Kitchen,Refreshment,IT,Internet (wifi),Equipment,Parking,Disabled access,Hearing loop,Disabled toilet,Conference",,,

Men's Sheds Cymru,Men's Sheds Cymru,"A man’s shed has, for generations, been a place for him to escape the stress and strains of life; a safe haven to gain much needed sanity; to be surrounded by his own useful things; a place to think; to make things; to mend things; to invent…..and men the world over have done this largely on their own.Men's Sheds is a new way for men to pursue their interests, develop new ones, belong to a unique group, feel useful, fulfilled and have a sense of belonging….the Men’s Shed movement has arrived in Wales.A Men’s Shed is a safe and nurturing environment where Men, who have time on their hands for whichever reason, can go to work on projects and activities which interest them. Men’s Sheds welcome everyone who have time on their hands whether that’s due to unemployment, retirement, bereavement, disability or simply if someone’s new to an area and are looking for ways of finding out about what’s going on within a community. We’re here to help get sheds up and running in communities such as yours, all across Wales.You can do anything within a shed – the choice of which activities to undertake is completely down to the shed members. Whilst many sheds work on woodworking or ‘hands-on’ projects, many sheds also work on other activities such as gardening, baking, model making, radio or arts based projects. The choice is entirely down to shed members – the one essential common strand being that the shed and its activities helps get people together for a chat and to meet new friends. The most important piece of equipment in each shed is always the kettle!The Men’s Sheds movement is very successful in other parts of the world (such as Ireland and Australia) and we think that a thriving network of sheds can be established in Wales. Our project is here to help promote the concept and to help form and support local ‘action groups’ which can lead to sheds being created.If you, or someone you know is interested in joining your local shed, you simply need you to get in touch. We can help to find your nearest shed or, if there isn’t a shed nearby, can help link you with other people in your area who we’re working with to create a shed.Men’s Sheds Cymru is a Big Lottery funded project to promote the development of new Men’s Sheds across Wales and to help existing Men’s Sheds achieve their full potential. The Men’s Sheds Cymru is a project promoted and managed by Hafan Cymru.","Head Office,Stephen's Way, Pensarn,Carmarthen,SA312BG","Community,Sport and recreation,Volunteering",info@mensshedscymru.co.uk,,,01267 225536,"Conference,Disabled access,Disabled toilet,Equipment",Self referrral,,

Advocacy Training,Let's Talk!,"Unfortunately, when someone has a lived experience of mental ill health their opinions, wishes, and choices can get lost or not taken seriously.  Also, medical professionals can often miss the importance of what a person with lived experience of mental ill health says, believing they know what is best for their patient.  These can have a direct effect on the person’s mental illness and state of mind, as well as treatments being prescribed or acted out that the person with lived experience of mental ill health does not want or need.  An  advocate is someone who helps support another person to express their views and wishes, allowing that person’s voice to be heard.  Within the context of this guide, an advocate is either the person with lived experience of mental ill health or is someone who is acting on behalf of someone with lived experience of mental ill health, in regards of asking for or exploring the possibility of receiving dual therapy (medication alongside talking therapies).",,Advice and advocacy,lets.talk@hafal.org,,,01792816600,,"Self referrral,By appointment only",'Monday to Friday 9am to 5pm,

Our aim is to hold day clubs for people with dementia and their carers to meet in a social environment in a local base: to give the person with dementia and their carer an opportunity for friendship, continued access to social life and to have enjoyment in life.The Clubs are run by volunteers, and this will hopefully integrate the people with dementia and their carers into the local community. The idea is that friendships will grow and thus as the carer becomes more and more isolated they will have someone to phone to talk to or meet for a cup of tea.What do we do in the Clubs?

Circus Eruption,Circus Eruption,"Circus Eruption exists to promote the social inclusion and integration of young people aged 11 to 19 through the medium of circus skills. Our main aims are integration, inclusion, participation, the learning of new skills in a safe environment, empowerment, creative expression, and the challenging of inequality, disadvantage and discrimination. We have noticed, with an astonishing degree of consistency, that our specific combination of different elements a non-competitive environment for learning, engagement in supported risk-management, experience of teamwork and co-operation, and opportunities for peer learning and teaching - leads to powerful and positive outcomes in terms of impact on young people and their lives. They gain in confidence and self-esteem. They become able to label themselves according to ability rather than disability - they become practiced at saying ""I can"" rather than ""I can't"". The integrated nature of Circus Eruption means that young people experience a non-judgemental and accepting environment, where they're encouraged to develop positive attitudes towards others and respect for diversity. Our project is participative - young people have a say in how the project is run. They understand rights and responsibilities and put democracy into practice. This leads to empowered young people who flourish as active citizens and understand how they can make a difference in the world. Though there are other youth circuses out there, they tend to focus on providing high standard skills and polished performances. Our strength lies in the impact we have on young people's lives. ""Social circus"" is becoming increasingly recognised as an important tool for engaging marginalised or disadvantaged groups, and we are keeping up with the movement.","Unit 10,Parc Tawe,Swansea,SA1 2AS","Mental Health,Disability,Sport and recreation,Youth",volunteer@circuseruption.co.uk,,,01792 474004,"Toilets,Kitchen,Internet (wifi),Parking,Disabled access,Disabled toilet","Drop in,Self referrral,Agency referral",,

"SPPOT, Supporting People and Pets Through Opportunity ' Training","SPPOT, A Community Interest Company","About SPPOTï»¿SPPOT (Supporting People and Pets through Opportunity and Training) is an innovative Community Interest Company which interests and inspires people who encounter it, whether they are the people for whom the organisation was set up, people who love dogs or fellow professionals working in either of SPPOT's dual spheres.SPPOT's Operations and Development Manager, Kerri Bee, set SPPOT up after realising, through a practice and management background in social care, that many disadvantaged people who value companionship and acceptance from dogs have few opportunities for flexible training and voluntary work services in the field of dog welfare. In addition through working as a Canine Behaviour Advisor, she also discovered that there is a lack of affordable services for dogs in Pembrokeshire and beyond, like dog walking and home boarding, especially for vulnerable dog owners.Together with a group of enthusiastic volunteers, SPPOT was created - a unique synergy based on a fundamental understanding of the needs of people and how they dovetail with the needs of dogs along with sound business principles, wide experience, skills, passion and entrepreneurial spirit.SPPOT is an Agored Cymru Recognised Centre enabling us to deliver accredited training courses, many that we have written ourselves, in canine training and welfare for various vocations and careers. We train people who are 'furthest from the job market' to become part of SPPOT's volunteer team as dog walkers, home boarders, training class assistants and instructors. In future, we plan to train dog day carers and rescue dog fosterers and also enable volunteers to set up their own micro-enterprises with individual levels of support, as we develop our services.",,"Older People,Mental Health,Animal welfare,Children and Families,Community,Disability,Education and training,Employment,Environment,Ethnic minorities,Health and social care,Sport and recreation,Volunteering,Youth",enquiries.sppot@gmail.com,,,01437 767648,,"Self referrral,Agency referral,By appointment only",,
